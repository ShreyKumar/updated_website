          Hi, my name is Shreyansh Kumar(Shrey). I was born in India, raised
          in Hong Kong and now studying in Canada at the University of Toronto.
          I started programming when I was in grade 10 and eventually fell
          in love with it. Since then, I have done internships at 4 different
          companies in 2 different countries and absolutely enjoyed it.
          <br />
          <br />
          I've been described by many people as a Natural Leader, Team Player,
          Perfectionist, Ambitious and Optimistic. I'm also very good at handling
          stressful situations and working under tight deadlines. Oh and I love playing video games
          especially League of Legends from time to time.

          <div class="rec">"Shrey was thrown in at the deep end when he came
            to join us over the summer, working initially on completely
            reworking the front-end of a legacy CMS, he later progressed onto
            one of our larger Drupal CMS client projects. Shrey learned quickly
            and adapted to using the technologies we threw at him while
            diligently following our development process, managing Git feature
            branching, deployments and working to sprints and bug reports
            set out in Jira. Shrey worked effectively with the design
            team and senior developers while carrying out his tasks and was
            a helpful and fun addition to the team."</div>

          <div class="rec">"Over the summer of 2015 Shrey worked as part of
            the core development team that built version 2 of RightBlue Labs'
            flagship software suite - LogIt. This software rollout enabled the
            company to greatly expand its business, including into new
            verticals. LogIt v2 was built from scratch on an entirely different
            tech stack than the MVP. Shrey worked across the stack, coding
            proficiently in JavaScript, JQuery, Python, Django, HTML, and CSS,
            despite not having any prior Django experience. Without Shrey's
            assistance we would have been hard-pressed to meet our ambitious
            software rollout deadline."</div>
